## Usage Instructions

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Space**: Start/Pause workflow animation
- **R**: Reset workflow to initial state
- **1-4**: Switch camera views (Perspective, Top, Side, Overview)
- **Tab**: Navigate between nodes
- **Enter**: Select focused node
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate nodes directionally
- **Escape**: Deselect current node
- **F1**: Show keyboard shortcuts help

### Mouse/Touch Controls
- **Click**: Select node or deselect if clicking empty space
- **Double-click**: Focus camera on selected node
- **Hover**: Show node information and hover effects
- **Drag**: Rotate camera (if OrbitControls available)
- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out

### UI Controls

- **Effects Toggle**: Enable/disable particles and glow effects
- **Quality Settings**: Adjust rendering quality for performance
- **Export Tools**: Capture screenshots or record videos

## API Integration

The system integrates with the HETROFL Flask backend through the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/metrics/latest`: Fetch current model performance metrics
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds
- Automatic node color/size updates based on accuracy
- Performance-based visual feedback

## Browser Requirements

### Minimum Requirements
- WebGL 1.0 support
- ES6 JavaScript support
- Modern browser (Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, Edge 79+)

### Recommended
- WebGL 2.0 support
- Hardware acceleration enabled
- 8GB RAM for optimal performance
- Dedicated graphics card for best experience

## Performance Metrics

### Target Performance
- **60 FPS**: Smooth animation at all times
- **<100ms**: Response time for interactions
- **<2GB**: Memory usage for extended sessions
- **Mobile Compatible**: 30+ FPS on modern mobile devices

### Quality Levels
- **Low**: 500 particles, 1x pixel ratio, simplified effects
- **Medium**: 750 particles, 1.5x pixel ratio, standard effects
- **High**: 1000 particles, 2x pixel ratio, full effects

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Low FPS**: Reduce quality settings or disable particle effects
2. **WebGL Errors**: Update graphics drivers or enable hardware acceleration
3. **Animation Stuttering**: Close other browser tabs or applications
4. **Mobile Performance**: Use Low quality setting on mobile devices

### Fallback Behavior
